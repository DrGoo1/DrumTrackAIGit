# DrumTracKAI WebDAW Specification

## Overview
The DrumTracKAI WebDAW is a specialized Digital Audio Workstation designed specifically for building custom drum tracks. It focuses on intelligent stem separation, arrangement analysis, and advanced drum creation tools.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Audio/MIDI Upload & Processing
- User uploads audio or MIDI tracks
- System automatically extracts stems for all non-drum instruments
- Each stem is placed in individual tracks labeled by instrument type
- MIDI tracks are played through a generic sound module for corresponding instruments

### 2. Arrangement Analysis & Timeline
- System analyzes musical arrangement parts automatically
- Arrangement sections include: Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Breakdown, Outro, Solo, etc.
- Sections displayed as slidable colored blocks on timeline
- User can add, delete, edit, and rearrange arrangement sections
- Timeline shows clear section boundaries and labels
- Visual indicator shows which section is currently being edited

### 3. Drum Creation Studio
Advanced drum programming tools for each arrangement section:

#### Interface
- **Modal Window**: Separate modal window interface
- **Admin App Integration**: Connected to admin app for drummer and rudiment databases
- **Sample Browser**: Integrated sample browser organized by drum type
- **Sample Audition**: Preview/audition samples for each drum instrument

#### Style & Performance Controls
- **Drummer Style Selection**: Choose characteristics of famous drummers (from database)
- **Tempo Control**: Adjust BPM per section
- **Velocity Control**: Dynamic range and accent patterns
- **Drum Rudiments**: Slider-based controls for rudiment intensity
- **Humanization Factors**: Timing variations, velocity fluctuations, groove feel

#### Timing & Feel
- **Push/Laid Back Playing**: Adjust timing feel (ahead/behind the beat)
- **Fill Configuration**: Customize number and types of fills between sections
- **Groove Templates**: Pre-built patterns for different styles

#### Output & Integration
- Drum parts are generated as MIDI notes
- MIDI is inserted directly into WebDAW tracks
- User can select drum samples from integrated database
- Real-time preview of drum patterns with selected samples

### 4. Final Output Options
- **MIDI Export**: Export drum performance as standard MIDI file
- **Audio Mix**: Import entire performance into specialized audio-output WebDAW for high-quality mixing

## Interface Requirements

### Layout
- **Mixer Position**: Left side of interface (resizable)
- **Track Alignment**: Mixer channels must align exactly with corresponding timeline tracks
- **Track Sizing**: All tracks must be same size and position
- **Pan Control**: Circular knob-style pan controls with return-to-zero function
- **Mixer Controls**: Volume, Pan, Mute, Solo, and Group controls
- **Level Meters**: High-quality professional level meters on each channel

### Excluded Features (Not Needed)
- Recording capabilities
- Audio effects processing
- Live input monitoring
- Multi-take recording

### Required Visible Elements
- Stem tracks with waveform display
- Arrangement section markers on timeline (slidable colored blocks)
- Drum creation studio interface (modal window)
- Sample selection browser (in drum studio, organized by drum type)
- MIDI piano roll editor (integrated if possible, separate window if not)
- Transport controls (play/pause/stop)
- Timeline with arrangement sections
- Track volume/pan/mute/solo/group controls
- Professional level meters
- Dedicated upload area with progress indicator
- Quantization controls for MIDI editing

## Technical Specifications

- Drummer style templates and characteristics
- Arrangement pattern recognition
- Genre-specific drum patterns

## User Experience Flow

1. **Upload**: User uploads audio/MIDI file
2. **Analysis**: System processes and separates stems, analyzes arrangement
3. **Review**: User reviews auto-generated track layout and arrangement sections
4. **Arrange**: User can rearrange song sections as needed
5. **Program**: User opens drum studio to create drum parts for each section
6. **Refine**: User adjusts drum samples, timing, and feel
7. **Export**: User exports MIDI or renders high-quality audio mix

## Visual Design
- **Theme**: Dark professional theme with purple and gold accents
- **Arrangement Editing**: Visual indicator showing currently edited section
- **Mixer Design**: Professional-grade interface with high-quality meters
- **Responsive Layout**: Resizable mixer panel and adaptive interface

## Success Criteria
- Seamless stem separation and track creation
- Intuitive arrangement editing with slidable colored blocks
- Professional-quality drum programming tools
- Realistic drum performance generation
- Efficient workflow from upload to final output
- Industry-standard interface design and usability
- Smooth integration with admin app databases
