# Drum Samples for Audition

This directory should contain drum sample files for the Edit Drums modal audition feature:

Required files:
- kick.wav - Kick drum sample
- snare.wav - Snare drum sample  
- hihat.wav - Hi-hat sample
- tom.wav - Tom sample
- ride.wav - Ride cymbal sample
- crash.wav - Crash cymbal sample

These samples are used by the Tone.js sampler in the Edit Drums modal for real-time pattern preview.

Sample format: WAV files, 44.1kHz, mono or stereo, short duration (< 2 seconds)

Note: Currently no sample files are present. The system will work but audition will be silent until samples are provided.
